## How It Works

Dead Canary operates by continuously monitoring your LAN. It checks the connectivity of devices at regular intervals. If it detects a failure, it triggers a graceful shutdown of the NAS to prevent data corruption or loss.

### Monitoring Process

1. **Ping Devices**: The watchdog sends ping requests to all configured devices.
2. **Analyze Responses**: It waits for responses and records any failures.
3. **Trigger Shutdown**: If a device fails to respond, the shutdown command is executed.

### ESP32 Role

The ESP32 serves as the central monitoring unit. It connects to your network and communicates with the NAS to manage shutdown commands.
